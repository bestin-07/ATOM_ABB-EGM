Implementation of ATOM - Advanced Tele-Operation Machine on ABB Yumi.\

Abstract :\
ATOM, Advanced Tele-Operation Method is a data capturing technique for teleoperation machines. This approach is cheaper, efficient and also reduces the requirement for wearable components compared to existing methods. It also provides feedback with a unique interface experience by exploiting the virtual reality technology. The VR eyewear gives us the 360 degree vision as seen through the eyes of the robot camera in a remote area. The proposed method uses image processing using the media pipe machine learning tool to detect and observe hand movement of the user, measures the spatial depth using object detection and  converts it into a useful format for controlling the arms of the robot. This gives us the dynamic experience along with an improved situational awareness while dealing with complex and risky operations. This method focuses on the ability of the proposed method to to retrace the users arm movements and gestures with minimum error using an open source 6 DOF -degree of freedom robotic arm.
